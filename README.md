# ðŸ©º Child Health Clinic Database System

## Project Description

This project is a **MySQL-based relational database** designed to support a child health clinic. It focuses on managing data for child health assessments, growth monitoring, immunization tracking, and referrals â€” all aligned with basic pediatric care workflows.

The database ensures data normalization, integrity, and easy access to important child health records.

---

## Objectives

- Maintain detailed **child and parent/guardian information**
- Record **appointments** and **health measurements**
- Track **vaccinations** per child
- Document **clinical observations** and **referrals**
- Support structured health records for **follow-up and reporting**

## How It Works
- When a parent brings a child to the clinic, a parent and child record is created.
- A new appointment is scheduled and relevant measurements are taken and saved.
- If required, vaccinations are logged, or a referral is made to a nutritionist or specialist.
- The clinician enters observations or diagnoses for the child.
= All data is normalized, eliminating redundancy and maintaining relational integrity.
